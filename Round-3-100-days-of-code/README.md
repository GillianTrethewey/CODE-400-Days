# Round-3-100-days-of-code

Third round of coding for 100 days. I'm taking notes to reflect on my learning and to be able to recall my progress.

All of the courses have their pros and cons. Overall I would recommend Skillcrush courses - the support is great. I would not recommend GeekPack since the code has not been reviewed and has errors. Free Code Camp was ok as a start but not in-depth.
